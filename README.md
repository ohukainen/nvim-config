# Neovim configuration
This is my nvim config, it started as a rewrite of [kickstart.neovim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) with additions from [ThePrimeagens config](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE). Now it is a restructured version that removed some of the more flashy parts of kickstart and I also added some new and (in my mind) improved keybindings. 

Feel free to use it with any modifications you want!
